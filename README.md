## ⏱ Timer-Based Quiz Mode

This mode adds a countdown timer to every quiz. When the timer ends, the quiz is auto-submitted.

### How It Works:
- Timer starts when the quiz begins.
- If user refreshes or closes the tab, timer continues.
- On timeout, results are auto-submitted.

🛠 File: `/scripts/timer.js`  
📍 Settings can be modified in `quiz-config.json`













# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
